# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

# Add "-codecov" to the env name to enable codecov.io reporting.
# See: https://github.com/codecov/codecov-python#using-tox
